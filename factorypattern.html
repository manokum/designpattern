        <!-- When To Use The Factory Pattern -->
        The Factory pattern can be especially useful when applied to the following situations:
        > When our object or component setup involves a high level of complexity
        > When we need to easily generate different instances of objects depending on the environment we are in
        > When we're working with many small objects or components that share the same properties
        > When composing objects with instances of other objects that need only satisfy an API contract (aka, duck typing) to work. This is useful for decoupling.
        <!-- When Not To Use The Factory Pattern -->
        > When applied to the wrong type of problem, this pattern can introduce an unnecessarily great deal of complexity to an application.
        > Unless providing an interface for object creation is a design goal for the library or framework we are writing, I would suggest sticking to explicit constructors to avoid the unnecessary overhead.
        Due to the fact that the process of object creation is effectively abstracted behind an interface, this can also introduce problems with unit testing depending on just how complex this process might be.
